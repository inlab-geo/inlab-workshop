Hello! Welcome to InLab workshop, where you'll be provided with a hands-on 
introduction to CoFI, illustrated through interactive problem solving.

All the materials, including slides and Python notebooks are going to be kept
in this repository. So you can always check back this repository after this
workshop for reference.
